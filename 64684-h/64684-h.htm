<p>The recent excavation of the building sites in the old Town of
Frederica has stirred interest in this now &ldquo;Dead Town&rdquo; and in
the fortification, Fort Frederica.</p>
<p>Fort Frederica, located at a bluff on the western shore of St.
Simons Island, Georgia, and on the Inland Waterway, was founded
in 1736 by the British under the leadership of James Edward
Oglethorpe, as an outpost to protect the colony of Georgia and
the other British possessions to the north against the Spaniards
in Florida. It became one of the most expensive fortifications
built by the British in America and the military headquarters for
a string of fortifications erected along this southern frontier of
Britain&rsquo;s provinces in North America.</p>
<p>The Town of Frederica, adjacent to the fort, was settled by
forty families brought here at that time. These settlers built Fort
Frederica and manned the fortifications until the coming of the
regiment of British soldiers two years later.</p>
<p>Occupying about thirty-five acres of land, the town was half
a hexagon in shape, divided by Talbott Street, generally called
Broad Street, into two wards&mdash;North Ward and South Ward&mdash;and
was laid out into eighty-four lots, which were granted to the
settlers and on which they built their homes. About half a mile
from Frederica, and surrounding the town on three sides, were
the garden lots while the fifty-acre tracts granted the settlers were
located in various parts of St. Simons Island.</p>
<p>Later, a larger area of safety being necessary, the entire town
was fortified and surrounded by a moat, the banks of which
formed the ramparts of the town. A wall of posts ten feet high,
forming the stockade and palisade, flanked both sides of the
moat, with five-sided towers on the corner bastions. Entrance
into the town was through the Town Gate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<p>This old Town of Frederica was a thriving community in its
day. The streets were lined with houses, some built of brick, some
of tabby, and others of wood. John and Charles Wesley, founders
of Methodism, who came to Georgia in 1736 as missionaries of
the Church of England, were in charge of religious affairs. The
town government consisted of a magistrate, recorder, constables,
and tythingmen. There were two taverns, an apothecary shop,
and numerous other shops and stores. The trades and professions
were represented by the hatter, tailor, dyer, weaver, tanner, shoemaker,
cordwainer, saddler, sawyer, woodcutter, carpenter, coachmaker,
bricklayer, pilot, surveyor, accountant, baker, brewer,
tallow candler, cooper, blacksmith, locksmith, brazier, miller, millwright,
wheelwright, husbandman, doctor, surgeon, midwife,
Oglethorpe&rsquo;s secretary, Keeper of the King&rsquo;s Stores, and officers of
Oglethorpe&rsquo;s Regiment. Frederica was a barracks town, so that
its business life was dependent on the money brought in by the
soldiers of the Regiment.</p>
<p>After the British victory at Bloody Marsh and the defeat of
the enemy in the Spanish Invasion of 1742 (War of Jenkins&rsquo;
Ear), peace was made with Spain by the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle
in 1748; and the regiment of British soldiers was disbanded the
following year.</p>
<p>Having gloriously achieved the purpose for which it was built,
Frederica now became a &ldquo;Dead Town.&rdquo; Gone were the soldiers
who had given it life, followed by the tradesmen and other settlers.
The houses fell into decay, brick and tabby walls tumbled, and
fire took its toll. Much of the old brick and tabby was hauled away
and used in structures erected during the plantation era and, in
time, no evidence remained on the surface to show that these
houses had ever existed. Other families came, built their houses
on these sites, and for generations lived within the confines of
the old town.</p>
<p>Of the several buildings Oglethorpe had erected within Fort
Frederica the ruin of only one remained and this was situated
on the property of Mrs. Belle Stevens Taylor. In 1903, Mrs. Taylor,
through her friendship for Mrs. Georgia Page Wilder, President
of the Georgia Society of the Colonial Dames of America,
gave to this Society the plot of ground on which stood this ruin,
which the Colonial Dames repaired and saved for posterity.</p>

<p>Four decades later, under the leadership of the late Judge and
Mrs. S. Price Gilbert of Atlanta and Alfred W. Jones of Sea
Island, the Fort Frederica Association raised the funds necessary
for acquiring the lands occupied by the old fort and town. In
1945 the property thus acquired was taken over by the National
Park Service and is now known as the Fort Frederica National
Monument.</p>
<p>Little was known about the lay-out of Frederica. Twenty-five
years ago the only published map which gave information about
the pattern of the town was that which forms the frontispiece
for the chapter on &ldquo;Frederica&rdquo; in <i>Dead Towns of Georgia</i> by
Charles C. Jones, Jr.<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a> Though this map gave the plan of the old
town, it was too small to be of any value.</p>
<p>The only maps available which gave any detailed information
about the fort and the town were those made in 1796 by Joshua
Miller, Deputy Surveyor of Glynn County, Georgia. These were
made by order of the General Assembly of Georgia, which named
Commissioners for the Town of Frederica, directing them to have
a resurvey made to lay out the town &ldquo;as nearly as possible to the
original plan thereof....&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a> One was a detailed map of the Town
of Frederica, showing the lay-out of the town, with the streets,
wards and lots, together with the number of each lot. Then, for
the first time was it possible to locate the exact lot on which any
particular settler had lived.<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a></p>
<p>In 1952 original manuscript maps of Fort Frederica and the
<span class="pb" id="Page_206">206</span>
Town of Frederica, dated 1736, were found in the John Carter
Brown Library, Brown University, Providence, R. I. The legend
states that these maps were made &ldquo;by a Swiss engineer,&rdquo; whom
the author has identified as Samuel Augspourger, a native of
Switzerland, who was surveyor at Frederica in 1736.<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a> The Augspourger
map of Fort Frederica is most valuable, giving information
about the fort, parapets, palisades, moat, and other details
which had hitherto been unknown. However, Augspourger&rsquo;s map
of the Town of Frederica gave no information as to the lot numbers,
names of streets, and other details which were desired.</p>
<p>Information about the Frederica settlers and their way of life
has been buried in old letters and other records. Only by careful
reading of available material in the scores of published and unpublished
volumes of the colonial records of Georgia could
small bits of such information be found and pieced together to
give the picture of early days at Frederica. It is known that
records were kept of the lot owners, for Oglethorpe wrote the
Trustees in 1738, &ldquo;I send you a Plan of ye Town of Frederica
with the Granted Lotts &amp; the names of the Possessors&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a> but this
list has not yet been located among Georgia&rsquo;s early records.</p>
<p>Even though these volumes of the colonial records contained
the names of many of the settlers and told of the part they played
in the life of Frederica, rarely did they contain information as
to the number of the lot which such individuals occupied. Not
until 1947 when the University of Georgia purchased a manuscript
collection of Georgiana, known as the Egmont Papers of
the Phillipps Collection, did this definite information become
available. From material in this collection Dr. E. Merton Coulter
and Dr. Albert B. Saye edited in 1949 <i>A List of the Early Settlers
of Georgia</i>, which gives the lot numbers granted these settlers
and makes it possible to locate each individual on the proper lot.</p>
<p>It is believed that this list was compiled in England by Viscount
Percival, Earl of Egmont, President of the Board of Trustees for
<span class="pb" id="Page_207">207</span>
the Founding of the Colony of Georgia, from information sent
over from Georgia from time to time. As is so often the case
with such records, there were errors. One such instance is the
listing of lot number 2, South Ward, Frederica, for Samuel Davison
and the same lot for Dr. Thomas Hawkins. Since the Hawkins
and Davison families came to Frederica at the same time and were
among the first settlers of Frederica, it is obvious that both of
them could not have had lot number 2, South Ward.</p>
<p>Davison left Georgia in 1741,<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a> moving to Charleston, S. C., and
Dr. Hawkins returned to England in 1743.<a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a> In 1767 George
Mackintosh petitioned for lot number 1, South Ward of Frederica
&ldquo;formerly belonging to Dr. Hawkins.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a> His petition was not
granted. In January of the following year Christian Perkins,<a class="fn" id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a>
widow, petitioned the Colonial Council, stating that &ldquo;there was
a Lot in Frederica known by the Name of Dr. Hawkins&rsquo;s which
was left in the Care and Possession of the Petitioner&rsquo;s late Husband
by John Hawkins the said Doctor&rsquo;s Brother who was supposed to
be entitled thereto That her said Husband from the Time the said
Lot was so left with him to the Time of his Death (being many
Years) had the Possession thereof and constantly accounted for
the Taxes and other Provincial Duties,&rdquo; and asked that it be
granted to her.<a class="fn" id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a> This was done, the lot being recorded as number
1, South Ward.<a class="fn" id="fr_12" href="#fn_12">[12]</a> Thus, in this 1768 record we have proof that lot
<span class="pb" id="Page_208">208</span>
number 1, South Ward belonged to Dr. Hawkins, leaving Samuel
Davison in undisputed possession of lot number 2.</p>
<p>The families who occupied these two lots were different in
every way. Dr. Thomas Hawkins and his wife, Beatre, who occupied
lot number 1, were troublemakers; in fact, Mrs. Hawkins
was known as &ldquo;a mean woman.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_13" href="#fn_13">[13]</a> Samuel Davison, with his wife,
Susanna, their little daughter, Susanna (born in England), and
sons, John and Samuel (born at Frederica),<a class="fn" id="fr_14" href="#fn_14">[14]</a> who lived on lot
number 2, were good citizens and well liked by the other settlers.</p>
<p>Dr. Hawkins was one of the important personages in the
community. Not only was he the surgeon in Oglethorpe&rsquo;s Regiment
and the medical doctor for Frederica and the other settlements
nearby, but he kept the apothecary shop, and was First
Bailiff. His house on Broad Street was his residence as well as
headquarters for his work. Here he saw patients and dispensed
drugs from his apothecary shop. He claimed his improvements
were &ldquo;superior to any other.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_15" href="#fn_15">[15]</a></p>
<p>In addition to his pay as surgeon in the Regiment, Hawkins received
a salary of thirty pounds a year as First Bailiff and was
allowed twelve pounds, three shillings, four pence, for clothing
and maintaining a servant, together with an allowance of four
pounds for the expense of &ldquo;public rejoicings, Anniversary Days,
etc.&rdquo; Also, he had an allowance of ten pounds for acting as correspondent
with William Stephens of Savannah.<a class="fn" id="fr_16" href="#fn_16">[16]</a></p>
<p>The Trustees sent him quantities of drugs, sugar, and tallow,
to use in his work. To enable him to go to Darien and other parts
of the Colony to visit the sick, he was allowed twenty-five pounds
a year for the upkeep of his boat, as well as the services of two
of the Trustees&rsquo; servants. Hawkins made charges for equipment
for this boat, such as blocks and rope, which the Trustees refused
to pay. Likewise they refused to pay the charge of one shilling
for sharpening two surgeon&rsquo;s saws, and fifteen shillings for cleaning
<span class="pb" id="Page_209">209</span>
and grinding his surgical instruments. In fact, he never seemed
able to put through an expense account!<a class="fn" id="fr_17" href="#fn_17">[17]</a></p>
<p>When he was not paid the sums he claimed, he wrote: &ldquo;I continue
the care of the sick, widows, servants and Indians and objects
of charity as well as the bailiffship but cannot get regular
payment....&rdquo; He further claimed &ldquo;my constitution [is] ruined
by fatigue; character hurted by Malicious Aspersions, My Dues
kept from me.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_18" href="#fn_18">[18]</a></p>
<p>There were those, however, who did not think he had earned
all he claimed. Thomas Jones wrote that &ldquo;he had not administered
one dose of physic to any poor person but refused, unless paid
for which has been done by contributions from the inhabitants....&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_19" href="#fn_19">[19]</a></p>
<p>Oglethorpe defended Hawkins and wrote the Trustees: &ldquo;I do
well know that he has attended the Sick very carefully and that
he constantly went up to Darien when I was here, and I suppose
he did so when I was not, It is no little thing to go in open Boats
in all Weathers near Twenty Miles &amp; no small Expence to hire
Men and Boats ... for tho he is very capable of Doing his Duty
as a Surgeon he is very ignorant in Accounts.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_20" href="#fn_20">[20]</a></p>
<p>Perkins, Moore, Calwell and Allen were among the Frederica
settlers who had altercations with Hawkins and two of his neighbors
wrote that &ldquo;if it were not for debts and demands made on
Hawkins there would be little use for Court at Frederica.&rdquo; In
1742 he was removed from office as First Bailiff.<a class="fn" id="fr_21" href="#fn_21">[21]</a></p>
<p>Beatre Hawkins and her friend, Anne Welch, wife of John
Welch, who with their three children lived a few doors down
the street on lot number 7, South Ward<a class="fn" id="fr_22" href="#fn_22">[22]</a> thoroughly disliked the
Wesleys. The Hawkins and Welch families had crossed the Atlantic
in the same boat with Oglethorpe and the Wesleys. During
this voyage religious services had been held for the passengers
<span class="pb" id="Page_210">210</span>
and Mrs. Hawkins had seemed greatly moved by John Wesley&rsquo;s
preaching and professed to be awakened to a new and better life.
Charles Wesley, observing her actions, saw through her hypocrisy
and warned his brother that her repentance was not genuine. She
learned of this and, so, hated the Wesleys.<a class="fn" id="fr_23" href="#fn_23">[23]</a></p>
<p>After their arrival at Frederica these women attributed Oglethorpe&rsquo;s
puritanical sternness to the moral and religious influence
of the Wesleys and conspired to bring about a break between
Oglethorpe and the clergymen. They fabricated a fantastic story
of their indiscretions and &ldquo;confessed&rdquo; these &ldquo;misdeeds&rdquo; to Charles
Wesley, then told Oglethorpe that Charles Wesley was spreading
this tale. It was not until John Wesley arrived from Savannah
that the matter was cleared up, the truth known, and mutual
respect restored between Oglethorpe and the Wesley brothers,
a regard which was maintained throughout the remainder of their
long lives.</p>
<p>After a few months in Georgia, Charles Wesley returned to
England. However, Mrs. Hawkins persisted in her efforts to persecute
John Wesley. On one of his later visits to Frederica she
sent for him. When he entered the Hawkins house, she, brandishing
a pistol in one hand and a pair of scissors in the other, threatened
to shoot him. Wesley held her hands so that she could not
use either weapon; whereupon, she seized his cassock with her
teeth and tore both sleeves to pieces.<a class="fn" id="fr_24" href="#fn_24">[24]</a></p>
<p>Her altercations with her Frederica neighbors caused one of
them to write, &ldquo;If that W[oma]n is to be punished in this World,
for her Wickedness, how dreadful will the example be? I grow
sick with the thoughts of her,&rdquo; and it was said, too, that Dr. Hawkins
was &ldquo;not atall beloved by the Inhabitants.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_25" href="#fn_25">[25]</a></p>
<p>The Davison family, on the other hand, were good neighbors
and were well liked by the other settlers. Charles Wesley called
Davison &ldquo;my good Samaritan&rdquo; and wrote of him and his wife,
<span class="pb" id="Page_211">211</span>
&ldquo;to their care, under God, I owe my life....&rdquo; Davison was said
to be &ldquo;one of the first of the industrious villagers.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_26" href="#fn_26">[26]</a></p>
<p>In addition to keeping a tavern, Davison was Second Constable.
In 1739 he was named Overseer of the Trustees&rsquo; Servants at a
salary of twenty-five pounds a year, but Hawkins took this position
away from him and named to this office one of the Trustees&rsquo;
servants who had just arrived from Germany and spoke
hardly a word of English. In 1740 Davison was named Searcher
of Ships at a salary of forty pounds a year.<a class="fn" id="fr_27" href="#fn_27">[27]</a></p>
<p>For a time Davison seemed to enjoy life at Frederica. Writing
to friends in London in 1738, he said that &ldquo;we all of us here have
been wonderfully protected by Almighty providence, very few
of us have died, &amp; none sickly; we have great encrease of Children,
&amp; women bear, that in Europe were thought past their time; The
Cattle and Hogs yt. were given us on Credit, thrive very well,
&amp; Fowls in great abundance, &amp; one may venture to say yt. ye place
is blest on our Accounts....&rdquo;</p>
<p>To another friend, he wrote &ldquo;my crop wch. was but very small
on Acct. of our being kept back in planting Season by ye alarms
of the Spaniards, ye land I got cleared being very good, gave me
great hopes; now this Year I have got at both plantations 6 acres
&amp; 38 perches of Land well fenced about 6 &amp; 7 foot high; &amp; planted,
wch. I hope in God will afford me &amp; my family Bread;...
My wife was brought to bed of a John in July last, a fine thriving
child, &amp; little Susan grows apace.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_28" href="#fn_28">[28]</a></p>
<p>However, in 1741, Davison with his family left Frederica and
moved to Charleston, S. C., complaining of the treatment he had
received from Dr. Hawkins and giving this as his reason for leaving.<a class="fn" id="fr_29" href="#fn_29">[29]</a>
It is not known when Samuel Davison died, but his wife,
Susanna, died in St. Bartholomew Parish, Colleton County, S. C.
in 1761. Her will (on file in the South Carolina Archives, Columbia)
names Susanna (who married John Smith), John, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_212">212</span>
Samuel, the children who had lived at Frederica; and William,
who was born after they moved to South Carolina.</p>
<p>It was known that Hawkins and Davison had adjoining lots,
that the houses had a &ldquo;party wall,&rdquo; that they were built of brick
and three stories high. When funds were made available for excavating
a small area in the Town of Frederica, it was decided to
begin with these two lots. The location of the &ldquo;party wall&rdquo; would
fix the lot line between these two lots, thus, making it possible
to set up the exact boundaries of all the Frederica lots.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">The Excavation of The Hawkins-Davison Houses, Frederica National Monument, St. Simons Island, Georgia</span></h2>
<p class="center">By <span class="sc">Charles H. Fairbanks</span><a class="fn" id="fr_30" href="#fn_30">[30]</a></p>
<p>The object of archaeological excavations is usually to discover
general information on the way of life of some people dead for
long periods of time. In the case of these excavations we were
faced with a more detailed problem, that of locating the remains
of the Hawkins-Davison houses, whose existence and construction
type was quite well known.</p>
<p>Fort Frederica National Monument is located on the western
edge of St. Simons Island. It was established as a national monument
to preserve the remains of the important 18th century fort
and town founded by James Edward Oglethorpe as a defense
against the Spanish in Florida. Only part of one building in the
fort and part of the regimental barracks are still standing. The
purposes of the excavation were to attempt to locate enough colonial
features so that the original layout of the town could be
tied to the existing topography, and to provide a field exhibit of
colonial architecture. The documentary information on the town
was compiled by National Park Service Collaborator Margaret
Davis Cate. Mrs. Cate, in addition to her general research on the
Town of Frederica, prepared a detailed evaluation of the documents
pertaining to each lot. This was extremely helpful in appraising
the historic material and formed the basis of the plan for
excavating, as well as for this paper. In addition to the letters,
the documents contained the Miller Map of 1796 which showed
the arrangement of the lots, streets, fort, and barracks as well
as showing the size of the lots and the width of the streets. The
map contained certain inaccuracies and did not show any point
that could be accurately located at the present time. In addition,
it did not show the location of any house in the town. For these
<span class="pb" id="Page_214">214</span>
reasons it was felt desirable to excavate a house site in the town
that might be identified through descriptions in the colonial documents.
The Hawkins-Davison houses filled these conditions, being
built of brick and having a common &ldquo;party wall.&rdquo; Thus it
was felt that these houses would probably yield identifiable remains
and it might be possible to locate the land lot lines and the
alignment of Broad Street, the main street of the town.</p>
<p>Dr. Thomas Hawkins, town physician and one of the magistrates,
was a member of the &ldquo;Great Embarkation&rdquo; of 1735 which
arrived in February, 1736. His household consisted of his wife,
Beatre, and servants Thomas Ayot and Richard Carpenter.<a class="fn" id="fr_31" href="#fn_31">[31]</a> Work
was started on the houses for the first settlers in February of 1736
and seems to have consisted at first of simple huts of poles covered
with palmetto thatch. Francis Moore, on his arrival at Frederica
in March of 1736 says that &ldquo;Each family had a bower of palmetto
leaves, finished upon the back street in their own lands; the side
towards the front street was set out for their houses. These
palmetto bowers were very convenient shelters, being tight in the
hardest rains; they were about twenty foot long, and fourteen
foot wide, and in regular rows, looked very pretty, the palmetto
leaves lying smooth and handsome, and of a good color. The
whole appeared something like a camp; for the bowers looked
like tents, only being larger, and covered with palmetto leaves
instead of canvas.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_32" href="#fn_32">[32]</a> By November of 1736 the first two houses
were nearly complete, three stories high, made of brick.<a class="fn" id="fr_33" href="#fn_33">[33]</a> It is
possible that these two were the Hawkins and Davison houses.
Dr. Hawkins said, in a letter to the Trustees in November, 1737,
that he had added half as much more to the length of his house.<a class="fn" id="fr_34" href="#fn_34">[34]</a>
In August of 1740 he had made another addition valued at &pound;60.<a class="fn" id="fr_35" href="#fn_35">[35]</a>
This completes the direct mention of buildings and additions to
the Hawkins house but a deposition taken in South Carolina in
1741 describes the two houses in some detail and is quoted at
length:</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>&ldquo;John Robertson, late brick layer in Frederica, in Georgia, maketh
oath and saith, that on or about the ninth of August last, being at work
on Mr. Davison&rsquo;s house, adjoining to Mr. Hawkin&rsquo;s, at the said
Frederica, on which the said Davison was putting a new roof, he
did propose to the said Hawkins, to take up a few shingles, and a
gutter belonging to the said Hawkins&rsquo;s house, and put the said gutter
on the party-wall, to which the said Hawkins agreed; saying that it
would be a benefit to him, because he must be obliged to alter the
roof of his own house soon: and the said Davison being to lay down
a new gutter at his own expense, it would serve for both houses, and
which must save one half the expense of the said gutter to the said
Hawkins. But the said Hawkins being out of town, a day or two
after General Oglethorpe sent to the said Davison, to forbid him
to touch anything belonging to the said Hawkins&rsquo;s house, though the
said gutter encroached fourteen inches on the said Davison&rsquo;s ground,
and the said Oglethorpe&rsquo;s own carpenter said it might be done in a
few hours, and without harm to the Doctor.* [Hawkins&mdash;in footnote].
That the said Oglethorpe did soon after, on the same day, stand on
the sill of the said Hawkins&rsquo;s window, and put his head up betwixt
the joists of the said Davison&rsquo;s house, and ordered Mr. Cannon to
build the said joists six inches lower; when the said Cannon told the
said Oglethorpe they were but six inches deep; when the said Oglethorpe
replied, he did not care, they might take it down, and build
the house six inches lower; when the said Cannon said, that one roof
would fall lower than the other, and that therefore it would be impossible
to make the said Davison&rsquo;s house tight, or keep it dry; then
the said Oglethorpe said, you might have thought of that before.
And further, that the said Oglethorpe did then say to the said Cannon,
if you touch a shingle of what the Doctor (meaning Hawkins)
has put down, I&rsquo;LL SHOOT YOU, to which he added a great oath,
for you have done more than you can answer in building so high
as to stop up the Doctor&rsquo;s window. That the said Davison being thus
hindered from finishing his house, was forced to remove his goods
from the said house (which was quite open,) and had only a stable
for his family to be in, until this deponent left the said Frederica,
which was on the 29th of September, 1741.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_36" href="#fn_36">[36]</a></p>
<p>We also know that Dr. Hawkins had planted two hedges on
his lot but there is no mention of fences.<a class="fn" id="fr_37" href="#fn_37">[37]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<p>Samuel Davison was a chairman by trade but had been brought
to Frederica to make musket stocks. He was married and had three
children. His was probably one of the two brick houses nearing
completion in November of 1736. By April of 1738 it was finished.
In January 16, 1740 Davison complained to Egmont that Dr.
Hawkins said &ldquo;when my house was finished he would sell my
children, one to the Carpenter, and the other to the Plasterer that
did my house, which is very cutting to a tender parent.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_38" href="#fn_38">[38]</a> The
deposition quoted at length on Dr. Hawkins&rsquo; house, of course,
applies to Davison&rsquo;s house as well. Davison also kept a tavern and
other references indicate his lot was fenced.<a class="fn" id="fr_39" href="#fn_39">[39]</a></p>
<p>From these references it will be seen that the two houses were
substantial enough to leave some remains, had a party wall which
would follow the lot line, and the presumed location of the
houses was in an area not heavily farmed in the last century.</p>
<p>It was hoped that the location of the party wall mentioned in
the documents would lead to a determination of the present location
of the original town lot lines. In this way we could locate
streets, lots, houses and other features of the colonial town of
Frederica. Rarely, I believe, has careful documentary research
been so well vindicated as in this case. We uncovered the wall
foundations of the Hawkins-Davison houses and clearly demonstrated
the present location of the line separating South Ward
Lots 1 and 2. The discovery of colonial wells yielded an additional
dividend of many objects which illustrate the early 18th Century
culture of the town of Frederica. In addition the exposed
foundations serve as a vivid illustration of the existence of an
English style of life established on the soil of Georgia.</p>
<p>The digging was started just to the west of the location for
the two houses indicated by Mrs. Cate. As the excavation proceeded
we uncovered the entire area of the two houses and tested
the sides of the lots for evidences of fences. The area of Broad
Street was trenched to prove the existence of the principal street.
The wells encountered were cleaned as far as time permitted. In the
<span class="pb" id="Page_217">217</span>
following account the features found will be described in the
order in which they were constructed by the colonists rather than
in the order of our discovery. This will give a much clearer
picture of what existed there in the colonial period.</p>
<p>All of the colonial remains were found to be covered by a
deposit of sandy humus from 0.7 to 1.0 foot deep. This had accumulated
over the foundations after the buildings collapsed in
the later part of the 18th Century. This was somewhat deeper
than had been expected and indicated the rapidity with which
remains are obliterated in the lush climate of the Golden Isles.</p>
<h3 id="c3"><i>The Hawkins House</i></h3>
<p>The house of Dr. Thomas Hawkins consisted of three rooms
in ground plan and will be discussed in the order in which the
rooms were constructed. At the west was a small room 10 feet
east and west by 15.3 feet north and south. The room had undergone
three periods of building but only the first period will concern
us here. This consisted of a footing ditch 1.3 feet wide on
the south and west sides. Six inch posts were placed in this ditch
at intervals of about one foot. These posts formed the framework
of a rather rude shed. The level of the floor is uncertain,
as it had been destroyed by later construction. This pole building
is believed to be the shed built at the time of the first arrival of
settlers in 1736. It evidently served as a shelter during the construction
of the main house which was built immediately to the
east. The description by Francis Moore<a class="fn" id="fr_40" href="#fn_40">[40]</a> of the palmetto bowers
built in February of 1736 said that they were built on the backs
of the lots. This hut was just the sort of construction one might
expect from the description given by Moore. Yet it is on the front
of the lot along Broad Street, and not on the back. The only
explanation is that Dr. Hawkins did not build his palmetto bower
on the back of his lot, or he may have built two, one at the back
and one at the front. The front one was later incorporated into
the main house.</p>
<p>Directly east and continuous with this original structure the
<span class="pb" id="Page_218">218</span>
main house was erected. It measured twenty feet east-west and
fifteen feet north-south, outside dimensions. The ditches for the
wall foundations were dug to a point two and a half feet below
colonial ground level. The walls were constructed of brick 3&frac12;&Prime;
x 2&frac12;&Prime; x 8&Prime; so the finished wall was one foot wide. The west wall
was without a break throughout its entire length, as was the
east wall which formed the party wall with Davison&rsquo;s house.
Both the north and south walls were broken by doorways three
and a half feet wide in the centers. Evidences of wooden door
casings were found in the doorways. The floor of the room had
been excavated two and a half feet below colonial ground level.
It had later been raised four times by sand fills averaging three
inches in thickness. Mixed with the sands was an occasional brick
as well as a few scattered English Delft sherds and bones of pig
and beef.</p>
<p>It seems that the floors were made of dry-laid bricks set in sand
without mortar. As the floor was raised each time, the bricks
were taken up and replaced at the higher level. When the house
was finally abandoned, the floor bricks were salvaged and thus
were absent at the present time.</p>
<p>The east wall was the party wall with the Davison house. In
the center there was a brick fireplace five feet wide and two feet
deep formed by extending pilasters one foot wide out from the
wall. The sides were plastered outside and inside with a lime
plaster, as were most of the walls of the room. The fireplace
had been re-built three times. The lowest level was the same
as the lowest and earliest floor level. Subsequently the brick
hearth had been removed, a sand fill five inches deep added and
the brick replaced. Similar replacements took place whenever
the floor was raised. The chimney evidently lay in the party wall
and was used by both houses, probably with separate flues. In
ashes resting on the hearth were found the broken remains of a
stemmed glass goblet. It is tempting to speculate that this is evidence
of the custom of hurling goblets, used in toasting royalty,
into the fireplace; possibly a toast to the king after the Battle
of Bloody Marsh.</p>
<p>Between the north wall and the fireplace was a bricked area
<span class="pb" id="Page_219">219</span>
four and a half feet wide and two feet deep. The bricks showed
no evidence of wear and this evidently represents the floor of a
corner closet. The closet had evidently been removed before the
floor was raised for the last time. On the floor lay a complete
musket bayonet which had been placed there in its sheath as the
copper sheath tip covers the point of the bayonet. There were
also two parts of a door lock and a few scraps of English Delft
and lead glass.</p>
<p>Three and a half feet north of the north wall of the room was
a brick wall running east and west. It was connected to the main
structure at the east by a short north-south wall and seems to
have been an outside stairwell to the second floor. This wall was
eleven and a half feet long, ending at the west just opposite the
western edge of the doorway. In order to give access to the ground
floor the steps must have run from the northeast corner up to
the center of the second floor. Thus the entrance to the ground
floor would be under the top of the steps. The area between this
wall and the main wall of the house was floored with tabby which
extended on the west to a point seven feet beyond the northwest
corner of the building. This tabby floor was littered with broken
crockery, glass, oyster shells, fish scales and animal bones. Evidently
household refuse was allowed to accumulate here under
the front steps, during the occupation of the house.</p>
<p>The next stage in the development of the house was a strengthening
of the western, original hut. This was accomplished by putting
wooden forms along the inside and outside edges of the
posts of the west wall and pouring tabby around the posts to a
height of one foot. This was applied only to the north ten posts
on the west side. On the south side a series of bricks was found
that evidently served as wedges against wall posts. The floor of
the room was at this time slightly more than one and a half feet
below ground level. A remnant of brick floor remained and it
seems likely that the entire floor was bricked. The floor was
littered with fragments of small glass bottles, small white Delft
ointment jars, several glass bottle stoppers, and an ivory enema
tube. This implies that the apothecary shop of Dr. Hawkins was
<span class="pb" id="Page_220">220</span>
located in this western room. It is suggested that the strengthening
of this hut into an addition to the house comprises the addition
of half the length mentioned by Hawkins in 1737.<a class="fn" id="fr_41" href="#fn_41">[41]</a> The 1740
addition was of brick and this west room is ten feet wide, half
the length, twenty feet, of the main house. There is evidence
of later repairs to the walls of this room but we do not know
of what these alterations consisted.</p>
<p>During the time from 1736 to 1740 when the main room was
in use two wells were in use successively just to the rear of the
Hawkins house. First was a rectangular well three feet south of
the rear wall and just east of the back door. This well had a rectangular
pit four feet square with posts at the corners which
supported a well house. The walls within the well were held up
by wooden barrels placed one above another with the ends
knocked out. The well was six and a half feet deep and there was
less than one foot of water in this well. Several peach pits were
found in the base of this well. The next well was circular directly
south of the back door. It was dug six and a half feet deep and
six feet in diameter. The well proper was bricked in, with a
diameter of three feet. This well contained a variety of objects
that had evidently been included in household trash which was
used to fill up the well when it was abandoned. They consisted
of:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">1 small lead glass round bottle, 50cc. capacity</p>
<p class="t0">1 square bottle, 1 pint capacity, probably a snuff bottle</p>
<p class="t0">1 round bottle, 28 ounces capacity</p>
<p class="t0">1 English brown salt glaze stoneware bottle</p>
<p class="t0">1 English brown and gray salt glaze stoneware mug</p>
<p class="t0">1 English white salt glaze stoneware mug</p>
<p class="t0">1 Small white English Delft ointment jar</p>
<p class="t0">1 yellow and brown striped lead glaze pot with handle</p>
<p class="t0">1 Japanese Imara porcelain bowl, blue on white with red and gilt overglaze enamels</p>
<p class="t0">1 claw hammer, complete with handle</p>
<p class="t0">a quantity of watermelon seeds and peach pits.</p>
</div>
<p>The well was abandoned and filled when it was decided to make
<span class="pb" id="Page_221">221</span>
another addition to the house. Tabby floor was laid over the
filled well and soon sank slightly into the well.</p>
<p>The last addition to the Hawkins house was made at the back
and measured sixteen and a half feet north-south and eighteen and
a half feet east-west. The western side was aligned with the western
wall of the main house, but the eastern wall did not use the
party wall. Instead there was a gap of one and a half feet between
the back rooms of the Hawkins and Davison houses. The brick
of the walls measured 4&Prime; x 2&Prime; x 9&Prime;, definitely larger than those
of the main house. At the southeast corner there was a large
buttress outside the wall, evidently part of a chimney foundation.
Inside the southeast corner was a corner fireplace set diagonally
across the corner. As the tabby floor of this back room sank into
the old well the depression was filled in with more tabby and
later another floor level was added. There is some evidence that
finally a wooden floor was installed, over the tabby.</p>
<p>There is no evidence as to the height of this back addition to
the Hawkins house. However, the Roberson statement of 1741<a class="fn" id="fr_42" href="#fn_42">[42]</a>
says that Oglethorpe stood in the window and put his head between
the joists of Davison&rsquo;s house. It is further stated that Oglethorpe&rsquo;s
action involved the roof levels of the two houses. Thus
it seems reasonable to assume that the joists mentioned are roof
joists. As the only place in the Hawkins house where a window
could face the Davison house is in the narrow gap between the
south addition and the Davison house it seems this addition must
have been three stories high. As this was the only addition to
the house that was made of brick it seems to correspond to that
mentioned as being completed by August of 1740 which cost
&pound;60.<a class="fn" id="fr_43" href="#fn_43">[43]</a></p>
<p>One other well belonging to the Hawkins lot was forty feet
west of the house just inside the western line of the lot. It was
circular and probably had a well house over it. Slightly over six
feet deep the walls were supported by another series of bottomless
barrels. It also had been filled with household trash including
a very fine musket bayonet. All these wells had planks laid across
<span class="pb" id="Page_222">222</span>
the bottom, apparently to prevent the well bucket from muddying
the well. This last well had in addition a large square post
of unknown use resting on the plank. Just west of the well was
a poorly defined line of root disturbances which may mark the
location of the hedge of pomegranates mentioned for Dr. Hawkins
lot.<a class="fn" id="fr_44" href="#fn_44">[44]</a></p>
<h3 id="c4"><i>The Davison House</i></h3>
<p>The home of Samuel Davison lay to the east of the east wall
of the Hawkins house. The front room was seventeen feet east-west
and eighteen feet north-south. Directly back of this was an
additional room twenty and a half feet east-west and eleven feet
north-south. The east wall, however, was straight, the extra three
and a half feet being taken up by a stairwell along the east side
of the north room. The floor of the north room had originally
been excavated to a level two feet four inches below colonial
ground level. Only a disturbed sand strata remained of the lowest
floor level, and it is not possible to determine of what the floor
was originally composed. It was soon covered with a tabby floor
whose upper surface was two feet below ground level. This floor
was later covered by a brick floor, set with tabby mortar in a
herringbone pattern. In the middle of the east wall there was a
doorway four feet four inches wide opening into the stairwell
on that side. The floor of this door appears to have joined a stair
up to the stairwell, possibly to both sides. In the southeast corner
of the north room was another doorway of the same width. A
short flight of steps remained leading from the floor level up to
the south. The steps are of brick with a four inch wooden nosing.</p>
<p>The north wall and the north half of the east wall were of
brick. The south half of the east wall and the south wall were
tabby. In the middle of the west (party) wall, directly opposite
the fireplace of Dr. Hawkins house, was a fireplace five feet wide.
It was formed by two short pilasters extending out from the wall.
At first these were slightly less than two feet long, but they were
lengthened at a later date to slightly less than three feet. The walls
as well as the fireplace were plastered. This, however, was not
<span class="pb" id="Page_223">223</span>
the finished wall. The brick and tabby floors did not come up
quite to the wall. The space between the floor and wall, four
inches wide, had contained wooden lath and a plaster coat &ldquo;furred&rdquo;
out from the masonry or tabby wall. This gave the room a double
wall and certainly made it drier and warmer than a plastered brick
or tabby wall, as in the case of the Hawkins house. This suggests
an explanation for the remark attributed to Dr. Hawkins,
that he would sell the Davison children, &ldquo;one to the Carpenter
and the other to the Plasterer.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_45" href="#fn_45">[45]</a> It is perhaps understandable
that the village doctor and magistrate would be irritated that his
neighbor could afford a tighter, drier house. The south room was
larger than the north but not so elaborately finished. Perhaps in
this case the boys in the back room were the less favored customers
at the Davison tavern. The walls appear to have been brick
with the exception of the north wall which was tabby. All the
walls had been salvaged down to the bottom course of brick so
that it is not sure that they may have been of wood or tabby
on a brick footing. However, the footings appear to be so similar
to those for the other brick walls that I think we may conclude
that they were, in fact, brick. The remains of a tabby floor covered
part of the room area and it is possible the entire floor was so
paved. There is a suggestion of steps down from outside to the
northeast corner of the room, but very little remained in this
section and the size of these steps cannot be determined. Just north
of the Davison house a narrow ditch running parallel to the front
wall was found. It is not certain what this represents except that
it is clearly some sort of front fence.</p>
<p>Samuel Davison ran a tavern and it seems the lower floor of
his house was the tap room. The large quantity of bottle fragments
and stoneware mug fragments found around the house
support this view. A total of 651 pieces of clay pipe bowls and
stems were found in and around the house. They reflect the 18th
Century custom of smoking in the taverns and give some idea
of the frequency of smoking as well as the fragility of the pipes
used.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">224</div>
<p>The Davison lot was supposed to be completely fenced and
efforts were made to locate the evidences of these fences along
the east, west, and south sides. A row of postholes was found
along the west side to the southwest corner and followed a short
distance along the south side. The east side seemed to have another
fence, but it was obscured by a series of wells as that along the
west side of the Hawkins lot had been.</p>
<p>South of the Davison lot an open space fourteen feet three
inches wide was found. South of that tabby remains were found,
but time and funds did not permit their exploration. The Miller
map of 1796 gives the width of the first street south of Broad
Street as 14 feet. The open space south of the corner of lot 2
fits this width quite nicely. The 1736 Auspourger map says that
the width of street &ldquo;C&rdquo; is sixteen feet. Only more thorough excavation
will clear up this point. In any case the tabby to the
south would be the remains of a building on South Ward Lot 19,
belonging to Thomas Sumner, or to South Ward Lot 20, belonging
to Daniel Prevost. The southwest corner of South Ward
Lot 2, Samuel Davison, was located with some accuracy. Measuring
north ninety feet, along the line of the party wall, the northwest
corner was found to be three feet north of the northwest corner
of the Davison house. The front stairwell of the Hawkins house
extended out into the street alignment a matter of six inches.
This line between lots 1 and 2 was taken as the base for laying
out the grid of town lots as shown on the Miller and Auspourger
maps. The town grid fits very well with the present contours
that seem to represent colonial features. It can be assumed that
the town grid of Frederica has again been determined. It should
be possible to locate any specific town lot from the information
now in hand.</p>
<p>Along the east side of the Davison lot a series of pits was
excavated in an attempt to locate the fence along that side. There
were postholes that very probably represent the fence but the
area was taken up largely by three wells, two round and one
square. Time permitted only the clearing of the square one. This
well was exactly what might be expected on the Davison lot,
the upper part had been filled with a solid mass of fragments of
<span class="pb" id="Page_225">225</span>
bottles, a total of five thousand three hundred and ninety-five
pieces. The quantities of glass and other household refuse in this
and other wells suggest that the colonists saved such materials to
fill old wells.</p>
<h3 id="c5"><i>Broad Street</i></h3>
<p>The present contours of the Frederica surface showed a depression,
approximately ninety feet wide north and south and 190
feet long east and west, just in front of the Hawkins-Davison
houses. East of this a similar depression extended on to the break
in the town rampart which was believed to be the location of
the town gate. This series of depressions had been considered
as the trace of Broad Street. A trench was extended across the
area to check the presumed location of the main street of the town.
No definite evidence of Broad Street was found. There were no
roadside ditches or any evidence of any sort of surfacing. Sixty-four
feet north of the Hawkins front steps there was a slight
depression in the old land surface. This ditch extended north another
twenty feet. At that point a low ridge bounded the depression
on the north.</p>
<p>The Miller map shows the width of Broad Street as 82 feet,
while Francis Moore says it was twenty-five yards wide<a class="fn" id="fr_46" href="#fn_46">[46]</a> and
the Auspourger map says seventy-five feet. The contours of the
ground fit the figure of eighty-two feet best. Until the recent
discovery of the Auspourger Map of 1736, it had been assumed
that the Francis Moore figure was an estimate and the Miller map
gave the true width of Broad Street. Now that the 1736 map
and Francis Moore both agree it may be assumed that Broad Street
was laid out with a width of seventy-five feet. We know that
the front steps of the Hawkins house infringed on the street a
matter of six inches. The depression in the old land surface at
the north side of the street marks the edge of the road in that
area. Further work will possibly locate fences or hedge lines that
will clarify this point.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">226</div>
<h3 id="c6"><i>The Mark Carr Lot</i></h3>
<p>At a point ninety-two feet north of the Hawkins house our
excavation uncovered the remains of a tabby wall. It was badly
decayed and was surrounded by the usual household debris which
marks the sites of houses. It evidently marks the south or front
wall of a house, built of tabby, on Lot 1 of the North Ward. This
lot belonged to Mark Carr, founder of Brunswick. At the present
time no records of a building on this lot are known. Time and
funds did not permit further exploration of the structure.</p>
<h3 id="c7"><i>The Artifacts</i></h3>
<p>Colonial archaeology is particularly fascinating because of the
great quantities and intrinsic interest of the artifacts recovered.
These objects are usually recognizable in spite of breakage and
corrosion. They immediately call to mind a host of associations
and functions that do much to enrich the picture of a living community.
In many cases they are objects of considerable esthetic
appeal and are prime museum exhibits. No detailed discussion
of the various classes of colonial relics can be made here. It will
be sufficient to call attention to those of special interest.</p>
<p>Items of military equipment were in a definite minority in the
Hawkins-Davison houses. Those of us who have been working
at Frederica have come to think its military aspects outweighed
the civilian facets. In these two houses a few musket balls, two
bayonets, and one sword scabbard tip indicate clearly that
Frederica enjoyed a life with a minimum of emphasis on the
martial, at least for the non-garrison people. Hinges, locks, nails,
and other hardware give us a good idea of how the houses were
constructed and furnished as to doors and windows. In this
connection the great quantities of window glass may surprise
many. What might be called the Daniel Boone Tradition has conditioned
us to think of our colonial ancestors living in poorly
lighted log cabins. Here at Frederica the wealthy, at least, lived
in brick and tabby houses with completely glazed windows.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">227</div>
<p>Many of the objects fall into the personal ornament and clothing
class. Buckles were very common, of iron or brass and often
tastefully ornamented. Buttons were generally of brass but several
gilded or gold plated examples exist. Two single cuff-links
or frogs were found. Both were made of copper or brass and set
with small blue &ldquo;stones&rdquo; of glass. Coins were relatively rare, only
three being found. All are George II English pennies bearing
the dates of 1739, 1738, and 1757. Household objects included
a brass candle-stick base, forks, knives, and spoons, one complete
pewter spoon being found. A clock key bears the Latin motto
&ldquo;Tempora Mutant,&rdquo; perhaps fitting for the stirring times in which
Dr. Hawkins lived. Common pins were much like the modern
ones and illustrate how little some everyday objects have changed
in two centuries.</p>
<p>Ceramics are usually of great interest to the archaeologist because
they reflect so clearly the changing styles and technology
of the times. A wide variety of pottery and porcelain was found,
surprisingly varied, as the excavations in the regimental barracks
had led us to expect a rather limited variety. The great majority
were simple earthenwares with various lead glazes. These were
made in England and used for kitchen and domestic purposes.
They range from large bowls to small oven casseroles. A few
sherds of Spanish olive jars were found, evidently loot from
Oglethorpe&rsquo;s expeditions against Spanish Florida.</p>
<p>There was a large group of soft-paste ceramics with yellow
and brown glazes that are the forerunners of the famous Staffordshire
potteries. The design is a random trailing of brown
lines on a yellow ground. They were apparently more kitchen
than table wares. Especially common around the Davison house
were pieces of English salt glazed stoneware mugs. White, grey,
and brown examples were found. All are tall mugs with large
handles on the side. They were apparently the common ale or
porter mug of the Davison tavern. Red and tan wares of the Nottingham
type were in a minority.</p>
<p>The chief table ware in both the Hawkins and Davison houses
was the blue on white soft-paste ware called variously English
Delft or English Faience. It is decorated with tin enamels on a
soft body, generally in blue on white; although green, red, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_228">228</span>
brown do occur. The designs mostly copy Chinese porcelains and
quite a variety is known. From the Hawkins house and wells
we have a number of small white English Delft jars that are evidently
medicinal ointment containers. All the fragments found
here seem to have been made in England, presumably in Lambeth
or Bristol. It is clearly the common table ware of the better sort
for the early 18th Century.</p>
<p>A relatively large number of porcelain sherds were found, especially
in and near the Hawkins house. At first it was assumed
that this was Chinese export porcelain. Expert identification indicates
that the bulk of this porcelain is Japanese Imara ware.
It was somewhat surprising as little trade with Japan might be
expected in the first half of the 18th Century. Occasional pieces
of Japanese porcelain had been noted from Spanish sites in
Florida but such a large collection had not previously been located.
The bulk of the porcelain is blue and white in floral designs.
Sometimes green, pink, and gilt were added over-glaze to
form very attractive decorations on handleless cups and shallow
saucers. Several pieces of Chinese porcelain are included in the
group. All this is another illustration of the rather luxurious life
of some of the colonists. True porcelain then, as now, was expensive,
especially so as it was not made to any extent in Europe
at the time and the pieces had to be brought from China or Japan.</p>
<p>Glass formed an important part of the collections and consisted
of several kinds. The most common was a squat round bottle of
a light chartreuse color which appears black by reflected light.
A few square bottles of the &ldquo;Case Bottle&rdquo; type are represented,
but most were of the round type. Smaller bottles were usually
in a clear or faintly bluish glass. The numbers found around Dr.
Hawkins house suggest that they were medicine containers. Two
types of glasses were present: tumblers and stemmed goblets.
The tumblers were rare and the prevalent type of drinking glass
was the stemmed goblet. Many of the stems had enclosed tear
drops and some had engraved designs around the rims.</p>
<p>In the wells organic materials were preserved below waterline.
Barrel staves and other wooden objects were quite common.
Peach pits, squash, and gourd seeds indicate some of the agricultural
<span class="pb" id="Page_229">229</span>
products. The second Hawkins well, sealed in 1740 by
the back addition to the house, contained a number of peach pits.
It seems doubtful that trees would have grown to bearing size
in the four years since the founding of the town and one wonders
if these pits may not be derived from Spanish trees found growing
on the island.</p>
<p>It is difficult to summarize the results of these excavations in
that the material found is really simply a demonstration of the
facts learned from the documentary research already so ably
conducted by Mrs. Margaret Davis Cate. However, we can point
out that the Hawkins-Davison house proved to be exactly where
the documents said it would be. All the additions and dimensions
given in the colonial sources were demonstrated to correspond
closely to those given. The location of the streets and their size
agree closely with that given on early maps and the location of
the town grid of Frederica now can be presumed to be firmly
established. Of course, any excavation only whets the appetite
for more and we hope to uncover more of the old Town of
Frederica. In the artifacts we find a reflection of the life of the
times. Each householder had in his home certain items of military
equipment and was prepared to stand to the defense of his town
and colony should the occasion arise. The houses, of some at least,
were well built of brick and tabby, well glazed and sturdy if not
commodious. Household appointments were as good as England,
with her world trade, could provide at the time. The sturdy
houses, lead glass goblets, and Japanese porcelain show that the

servants, came at the same time. (E. M. Coulter and A. B. Saye, eds.,

his death married Francis Lewis. In her will (executed in 1786 and recorded
in 1811) on file in Chatham County, Georgia, Court House (Will Book E,
84), she left her Frederica lots (17N and 1S) to her brother, Peter Grant.
However, in 1789 she executed a deed transferring lot 17N &ldquo;to my loving
nephew ... Thomas Grant, son of my brother, Peter Grant.&rdquo; (Glynn County,

distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
